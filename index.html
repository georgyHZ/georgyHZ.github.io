                        Motivation, a word that can mean different things to different people.
                        <br>
                        But by it’s literal definition it’s a reason, a ‘why?,’ for one thing or the other. In this case, what is my reason for choosing ICT?
                        <br>
                        First of all I would say that my main reason is a material one. In this day and age with enough determination you can learn almost anything without setting foot in an educational institution. 
                        <br>
                        But an education certified and vetoed by a university can not only provide you with better quality hands-on experience than you can usually get by yourself. But it is also pretty much necessary for optimal career growth.
                        <br>
                        Secondly I will write a little bit more about my overall motivation for studying ICT.
                        <br>
                        There is a proverb that says - “You live a hundred years, you learn a hundred years”. That is a philosophy that I try to take to heart. I’ve judged ICT to be the best thing for me to learn at the moment due to the stability of the professional field and me already being fairly comfortable with some of it’s aspects. 
                        <br>
                        If in the future I will not end up being passionate about pursuing it further, I will still be left with a strong starting financial platform for any other venture that I might find myself longing for.

                    <p class="h1 heading">Compatibility</p>
                    <p class="home-paragraph">To me, there hasn’t really been a question in a long time, as to whether I would be compatible with the subject of Information and Communication Technologies. 
                        <br>
                        Since young age I’ve been exposed to it in both a casual and a formal way. From engaging with IT related events, due to members of my family working in the sphere, all the way to gaining some minor knowledge myself while working through many internet guides, tutorials and courses since a young age.
                        <br>
                        Although I can’t say that coding is my life’s passion, and I want do it 24 hours a day until the day I die. I can say that i’m fine with most aspects of it, even enjoying some angles of problem solving and practical applications.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I can say that so far things are as I expected them to be.
